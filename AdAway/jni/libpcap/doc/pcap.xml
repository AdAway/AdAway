      <keyword>Libpcap, dump file format</keyword>
         <abstract>
<t>This document describes a format to dump captured packets on a file. This format is extensible and it is currently proposed for implementation in the libpcap/WinPcap packet capture library.</t>

<section title="Objectives">
<t>The problem of exchanging packet traces becomes more and more critical every day; unfortunately, no standard solutions exist for this task right now. One of the most accepted packet interchange formats is the one defined by libpcap, which is rather old and does not fit for some of the nowadays applications especially in terms of extensibility.</t>
<t>This document proposes a new format for dumping packet traces. The following goals are being pursued:</t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Extensibility: aside of some common functionalities, third parties should be able to enrich the information embedded in the file with proprietary extensions, which will be ignored by tools that are not able to understand them.</t>
<t>Portability: a capture trace must contain all the information needed to read data independently from network, hardware and operating system of the machine that made the capture.</t>
<t>Merge/Append data: it should be possible to add data at the end of a given file, and the resulting file must still be readable.</t>
</list>

<section title="General File Structure">

<section anchor="sectionblock" title="General Block Structure">
<t>A capture file is organized in blocks, that are appended one to another to form the file. All the blocks share a common format, which is shown in <xref target="formatblock"/>.</t>

<t>The fields have the following meaning:</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>Block Type (32 bits): unique value that identifies the block. Values whose Most Significant Bit (MSB) is equal to 1 are reserved for local use. They allow to save private data to the file and to extend the file format.</t>
<t>Block Total Length: total size of this block, in bytes. For instance, a block that does not have a body has a length of 12 bytes.</t>
<t>Block Body: content of the block.</t>
<t>Block Total Length: total size of this block, in bytes. This field is duplicated for permitting backward file navigation.</t>
</list>

<t>This structure, shared among all blocks, makes easy to process a file and to skip unneeded or unknown blocks. Blocks can be nested one inside the others (NOTE: needed?). Some of the blocks are mandatory, i.e. a dump file is not valid if they are not present, other are optional.</t>
<t>The structure of the blocks allows to define other blocks if needed. A parser that does non understand them can simply ignore their content.</t>
</section>

<section title="Block Types">
<t>The currently defined blocks are the following:</t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>Section Header Block: it defines the most important characteristics of the capture file.</t>
<t>Interface Description Block: it defines the most important characteristics of the interface(s) used for capturing traffic.</t>
<t>Packet Block: it contains a single captured packet, or a portion of it.</t>
<t>Simple Packet Block: it contains a single captured packet, or a portion of it, with only a minimal set of information about it.</t>
<t>Name Resolution Block: it defines the mapping from numeric addresses present in the packet dump and the canonical name counterpart.</t>
<t>Capture Statistics Block: it defines how to store some statistical data (e.g. packet dropped, etc) which can be useful to undestand the conditions in which the capture has been made.</t>
<t>Compression Marker Block: TODO</t>
<t>Encryption Marker Block: TODO</t>
<t>Fixed Length Marker Block: TODO</t>
</list>

<t>The following blocks instead are considered interesting but the authors believe that they deserve more in-depth discussion before being defined:</t>
<list style="numbers">
<t>Further Packet Blocks</t>
<t>Directory Block</t>
<t>Traffic Statistics and Monitoring Blocks</t>
<t>Alert and Security Blocks</t>
</list>

<t>TODO Currently standardized Block Type codes are specified in Appendix 1.</t>

</section>

<section title="Block Hierarchy and Precedence">
<t>The file must begin with a Section Header Block. However, more than one Section Header Block can be present on the dump, each one covering the data following it till the next one (or the end of file). A Section includes the data delimited by two Section Header Blocks (or by a Section Header Block and the end of the file), including the first Section Header Block.</t>
<t>In case an application cannot read a Section because of different version number, it must skip everything until the next Section Header Block. Note that, in order to properly skip the blocks until the next section, all blocks must have the fields Type and Length at the beginning. This is a mandatory requirement that must be maintained in future versions of the block format.</t>
<t><xref target="fssample-SHB"/> shows two valid files: the first has a typical configuration, with a single Section Header that covers the whole file. The second one contains three headers, and is normally the result of file concatenation. An application that understands only version 1.0 of the file format skips the intermediate section and restart processing the packets after the third Section Header.</t>

<t>NOTE: TO BE COMPLETED with some examples of other blocks</t>

</section>

<section title="Data format">
<t>Data contained in each section will always be saved according to the characteristics (little endian / big endian) of the dumping machine. This refers to all fields that are saved as numbers and that span over two or more bytes.</t>
<t>The approach of having each section saved in the native format of the generating host is more efficient because it avoids translation of data when reading / writing on the host itself, which is the most common case when generating/processing capture dumps.</t>
<t>TODO Probably we have to specify something more here. Is what we're saying enough to avoid any kind of ambiguity?.</t>

<t>The Section Header Block does not contain data but it rather identifies a list of blocks (interfaces, packets) that are logically correlated. This block does not contain any reference to the size of the section it is currently delimiting, therefore the reader cannot skip a whole section at once. In case a section must be skipped, the user has to repeatedly skip all the blocks contained within it; this makes the parsing of the file slower but it permits to append several capture dumps at the same file.</t>
</section>

<section anchor="sectionidb" title="Interface Description Block (mandatory)">
<t>The Interface Description Block is mandatory. This block is needed to specify the characteristics of the network interface on which the capture has been made. In order to properly associate the captured data to the corresponding interface, the Interface Description Block must be defined before any other block that uses it; therefore, this block is usually placed immediately after the Section Header Block.</t>

<t>An Interface Description Block is valid only inside the section which it belongs to. The structure of a Interface Description Block is shown in <xref target="formatidb"/>.</t>

<t>The Packet Block has the following fields:</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>Interface ID: Specifies the interface this packet comes from, and corresponds to the ID of one of the Interface Description Blocks present in this section of the file (see <xref target="formatidb"/>).</t>
<t>Drops Count: a local drop counter. It specified the number of packets lost (by the interface and the operating system) between this packet and the preceding one. The value xFFFF (in hexadecimal) is reserved for those systems in which this information is not available.</t>
<t>Timestamp (High): the most significative part of the timestamp. in standard Unix format, i.e. from 1/1/1970.</t>
<t>Timestamp (Low): the less significative part of the timestamp. The way to interpret this field is specified by the 'ts_accur' option (see <xref target="formatidb"/>) of the Interface Description block referenced by this packet. If the Interface Description block does not contain a 'ts_accur' option, then this field is expressed in microseconds.</t>
<t>Captured Len: number of bytes captured from the packet (i.e. the length of the Packet Data field). It will be the minimum value among the actual Packet Length and the snapshot length (defined in <xref target="formatidb"/>).</t>
<t>Packet Len: actual length of the packet when it was transmitted on the network. Can be different from Captured Len if the user wants only a snapshot of the packet.</t>
<t>Packet Data: the data coming from the network, including link-layer headers. The length of this field is Captured Len. The format of the link-layer headers depends on the LinkType field specified in the Interface Description Block (see <xref target="sectionidb"/>) and it is specified in Appendix XXX (TODO).</t>
<t>Options: optionally, a list of options (formatted according to the rules defined in <xref target="sectionopt"/>) can be present.</t>
</list>

<t></t>
</section>


<section title="Simple Packet Block (optional)">
<t>The Simple Packet Block is a lightweight container for storing the packets coming from the network. Its presence is optional.</t>
<t>A Simple Packet Block is similar to a Packet Block (see <xref target="sectionpb"/>), but it is smaller, simpler to process and contains only a minimal set of information. This block is preferred to the standard Packet Block when performance or space occupation are critical factors, such as in sustained traffic dump applications. A capture file can contain both Packet Blocks and Simple Packet Blocks: for example, a capture tool could switch from Packet Blocks to Simple Packet Blocks when the hardware resources become critical.</t>
<t>The Simple Packet Block does not contain the Interface ID field. Therefore, it must be assumed that all the Simple Packet Blocks have been captured on the interface previously specified in the Interface Description Block.</t>

<t>The Packet Block has the following fields:</t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>Packet Len: actual length of the packet when it was transmitted on the network. Can be different from captured len if the packet has been truncated.</t>
<t>Packet data: the data coming from the network, including link-layers headers. The length of this field can be derived from the field Block Total Length, present in the Block Header.</t>
</list>

<t>The Simple Packet Block does not contain the timestamp because this is one of the most costly operations on PCs. Additionally, there are applications that do not require it; e.g. an Intrusion Detection System is interested in packets, not in their timestamp.</t>

<t>The Simple Packet Block is very efficient in term of disk space: a snapshot of length 100 bytes requires only 16 bytes of overhead, which corresponds to an efficiency of more than 86%.</t>

</section>



<section title="Name Resolution Block (optional)">
<t>The Name Resolution Block is used to support the correlation of numeric addresses (present in the captured packets) and their corresponding canonical names and it is optional. Having the literal names saved in the file, this prevents the need of a name resolution in a delayed time, when the association between names and addresses can be different from the one in use at capture time. Moreover, The Name Resolution Block avoids the need of issuing a lot of DNS requests every time the trace capture is opened, and allows to have name resolution also when reading the capture with a machine not connected to the network.</t>
<t>The format of the Name Resolution Block is shown in <xref target="formatnrb"/>.</t>

  <c>Variable</c>
  <c>Specifies an IPv6 address (contained in the first 16 bytes), followed by one or more zero-terminated strings containing the DNS entries for that address.</c>
</texttable>

<t>After the list or Name Resolution Records, optionally, a list of options (formatted according to the rules defined in <xref target="sectionopt"/>) can be present.</t>

<t>A Name Resolution Block is normally placed at the beginning of the file, but no assumptions can be taken about its position. Name Resolution Blocks can be added in a second time by tools that process the file, like network analyzers.</t>

<t>In addiction to the options defined in <xref target="sectionopt"/>, the following options are valid within this block:</t>

<section anchor="sectionopt" title="Options">
<t>Almost all blocks have the possibility to embed optional fields. Optional fields can be used to insert some information that may be useful when reading data, but that it is not really needed for packet processing. Therefore, each tool can be either read the content of the optional fields (if any), or skip them at once.</t>
<t>Skipping all the optional fields at once is straightforward because most of the blocks have a fixed length, therefore the field Block Length (present in the General Block Structure, see  <xref target="sectionblock"/>) can be used to skip everything till the next block.</t>

<t>Options are a list of Type - Length - Value fields, each one containing a single value:</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>Option Type (2 bytes): it contains the code that specifies the type of the current TLV record. Option types whose Most Significant Bit is equal to one are reserved for local use; therefore, there is no guarantee that the code used is unique among all capture files (generated by other applications). In case of vendor-specific extensions that have to be identified uniquely, vendors must request an Option Code whose MSB is equal to zero.</t>
<t>Option Length (2 bytes): it contains the length of the following 'Option Value' field.</t>
<t>Option Value (variable length): it contains the value of the given option. The length of this field as been specified by the Option Length field.</t>
</list>

<t>Options may be repeated several times (e.g. an interface that has several IP addresses associated to it). The option list is terminated by a special code which is the 'End of Option'.</t>

<t>One or more blocks could be defined to contain network statistics or traffic monitoring information. They could be use to store data collected from RMON or Netflow probes, or from other network monitoring tools.</t>
</section>

<section title="Event/Security Block (experimental)">
<t>This block could be used to store events. Events could contain generic information (for example network load over 50%, server down...) or security alerts. An event could be:</t>

<list style="symbols">
<t>skipped, if the application doesn't know how to do with it</t>
<t>processed independently by the packets. In other words, the applications skips the packets and processes only the alerts</t>
<t>processed in relation to packets: for example, a security tool could load only the packets of the file that are near a security alert; a monitorg tool could skip the packets captured while the server was down.</t>

<section title="Conclusions">
<t>The file format proposed in this document should be very versatile and satisfy a wide range of applications.
In the simplest case, it can contain a raw dump of the network data, made of a series of Simple Packet Blocks.
In the most complex case, it can be used as a repository for heterogeneous information.
In every case, the file remains easy to parse and an application can always skip the data it is not interested in; at the same time, different applications can share the file, and each of them can benfit of the information produced by the others.
Two or more files can be concatenated obtaining another valid file.</t>
