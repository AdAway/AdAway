/*
 * An OS-independent signal() with, whenever possible, partial BSD
 * semantics, i.e. the signal handler is restored following service
 * of the signal, but system calls are *not* restarted, so that if
 * "pcap_breakloop()" is called in a signal handler in a live capture,
 * the read/recvfrom/whatever in the live capture doesn't get restarted,
 * it returns -1 and sets "errno" to EINTR, so we can break out of the
 * live capture loop.
 *
 * We use "sigaction()" if available.  We don't specify that the signal
 * should restart system calls, so that should always do what we want.
 *
 * Otherwise, if "sigset()" is available, it probably has BSD semantics
 * while "signal()" has traditional semantics, so we use "sigset()"; it
 * might cause system calls to be restarted for the signal, however.
 * I don't know whether, in any systems where it did cause system calls to
 * be restarted, there was a way to ask it not to do so; there may no
 * longer be any interesting systems without "sigaction()", however,
 * and, if there are, they might have "sigvec()" with SV_INTERRUPT
 * (which I think first appeared in 4.3BSD).
 *
 * Otherwise, we use "signal()" - which means we might get traditional
 * semantics, wherein system calls don't get restarted *but* the
 * signal handler is reset to SIG_DFL and the signal is not blocked,
 * so that a subsequent signal would kill the process immediately.
 *
 * Did I mention that signals suck?  At least in POSIX-compliant systems
 * they suck far less, as those systems have "sigaction()".
