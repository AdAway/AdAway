<h2>由广告带来的收入</h2>
<p>通常有一种误解认为如果用户从来不点击广告，那么屏蔽广告并不会给网站或者开发人员带来财务上的损失。然而，事实是仅仅展示广告也可以使开发人员获得收入。是否屏蔽广告取决于你。就我个人来说，我不会使用展示广告的应用，因为那让我很烦，所以没有一个屏蔽软件的话我是不会安装那些应用的</p>



<h2>AdAway是怎么工作的呢</h2>
<p>AdAway uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_file">hosts file</a> to block hostnames, that serve advertisements. The hosts file is a file found in <tt>/system/etc/hosts</tt> that maps hostnames to IP addresses. It is a traditional way to define hostname to IP address pairs without relying on the Domain Name System (DNS). All unwanted hostnames are redirected to <tt>127.0.0.1</tt> which means they will point to your own device.</p>

<h2>Why is the daily update check preference grayed out?</h2>
<p>Automatic checking for new updates is only available when AdAway is installed on the internal phone memory. This is due to restrictions on the Android platform.</p>

<h2>Why do I have to restart Android for changes to take effect?</h2>
<p>Java on Android maintains its own internal DNS cache. The operating system will reflect the new hosts file immediately (verify that with ping on the command line) but you'll need to restart Android to rebuild the DNS cache of Java.</p>

<h2>How to use the webserver in AdAway?</h2>
<p><b>AdAway will also work without using the webserver!</b>
<br/><br/>You can enable a local webserver in preferences of AdAway to answer requests to the local IP address <tt>127.0.0.1</tt>. This means requests from applications to ad servers which are redirected to <tt>127.0.0.1</tt> are answered by AdAway's webserver.
<br/>Some applications refuse to work, when ad servers are not reachable. With this method they will be reachable again, replying with a blank page and no ad images.</p>

<h2>How can I block/unblock specific hostnames?</h2>
<p>Add the hostnames you want to block to the Blacklist (=Black) under <i>Your Lists</i>. Additionally, hostnames you want to exclude from blocking can be added to the <i>Whitelist</i> (=White) and hostnames you want to redirect to a specific IP address belong to the <i>Redirection List</i> (=Redirection).</p>

<h2>Where can I find more hosts sources?</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/dschuermann/ad-away/wiki/HostsSources">List of additional hosts sources for AdAway</a>.</p>
