## Installing

There are two kinds of release:
* The preview builds: on the bleeding edge of development - for testers or adventurous
* The stable builds: ready for every day usage - for end users

### Preview builds

**Requirements:** Android 8 _Oreo_ or above

For users with bugs, there may be preview builds available from the [XDA development thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2190753) and [AdAway official website](https://app.adaway.org/beta.apk).
It is recommended to try those builds to see if your issue is resolved before creating an issue.
The preview builds may contain bug fixes or new features for new android versions.
