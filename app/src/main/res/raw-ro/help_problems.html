<h2>Spatiu insuficient pe partitie</h2>
<p>Try changing the target hosts file in preferences to <code>/data/data/hosts</code> (or <code>/data/hosts</code>) and apply AdAway again.</p>

<h2>Nu functioneaza pe Android 4.4+</h2>
<p>Try changing the target hosts file in preferences from <code>/data/data/hosts</code> to <code>/data/hosts</code> or <code>/system/etc/hosts</code> and apply AdAway again.</p>

<h2>Nu blocheaza reclamele in aplicatia XYZ!</h2>
<p>Some hostnames may be missing in the provided hosts files from the <cite>Hosts Sources</cite> or the application has bundled the images to provide ads without accessing the internet.<br><br>
You can log DNS requests (Menu-&gt;Log DNS Requests) from AdAway to find out which additional hostnames have to be blocked.
<br><br>Add the suspicious hostnames to your own Blacklist by long pressing the entries in the Log and report these hostnames when you have verified them in the Forum <a href="http://forum.hosts-file.net/viewforum.php?f=9">Hosts Inbox</a> of <a href="http://hosts-file.net">hosts-file.net</a>.</p>

<h2>Cached Advertisements</h2>
<p>Uneori,aplicatiile salveaza reclamele dupa downloadare. Asta inseamna ca unele aplicatii vor avea reclame ramase nesterse. O solutie este stergerea cache-ului acestor aplicatii din meniul Setari-&gt;Aplicatii.</p>

<h2>Aplicatia XYZ nu mai functioneaza!</h2>
<p>Some applications need to communicate with a hostname that is blocked by AdAway or refuse to work when the hostnames which should serve ads are not reachable. See <a href="https://github.com/AdAway/AdAway/wiki/ProblematicApps">https://github.com/AdAway/AdAway/wiki/ProblematicApps</a> to get a list of known applications that have problems. Otherwise, find out which hostnames are needed and add them to your <cite>Whitelist</cite> under <cite>Your Lists</cite> and report them to the <a href="https://github.com/AdAway/AdAway/issues">bug tracker of AdAway</a>.</p>

<h2>The back button in web browsers is not working</h2>
<p>You can enable AdAway's local webserver in preferences as a workaround.</p>
