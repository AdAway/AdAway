<h2>HTC Devices</h2>
<p>AdAway does not work when you are using a device with so called S-ON. This 'feature' exists on many HTC devices and prevents AdAway from writing the hosts file.</p>

<h2>S-ON/S-OFF?</h2>
<p>S-OFF means that the NAND portion of the device is unlocked and can be written to. The default setting for HTC devices is S-ON, which means that neither can you access certain areas of the system nor can you guarantee a permanent root. Furthermore, signature check for firmware images is also ensured by the S-ON flag.</p>

<h2>Do I have S-ON or S-OFF?</h2>
<p>Boot into the Boot Menu on your device by holding down <cite>volume down</cite> button while pressing power and the text on top will show the flag status as either S-OFF or S-ON. A full root generally means S-OFF.
<br><br>More information can be found on <a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mobile/what-is-s-off-how-to-gain-it-on-htc-android-phones-with-unrevoked-forever/">www.addictivetips.com</a>. Additional S-OFF methods since Unrevokable (in link) might interest you, namely: Revolutionary, Revone, Firewater, RumRunner, Moonshine, SunShineâ€¦</p>

<h2>Workaround</h2>
<p>Prerequisite: You have to install a working Android SDK with ADB shell on your PC.</p>
<ol>
<li>Boot into the Boot Menu on your device by holding down <cite>volume down</cite> button while pressing power.</li>
<li>Use <cite>volume down</cite> to select <cite>recovery</cite> then <cite>power</cite> to boot it.</li>
<li>In clockwork recovery go to "partitions menu".</li>
<li>Select <cite>mount /system</cite>, <cite>mount /sdcard</cite> and <cite>mount /data</cite>.</li>
<li>Plug in your USB cord and open a command line on your pc.</li>
<li>Enter adb shell and type <code>ln -s /data/hosts /system/etc/hosts</code> (This creates a symbolic link, which allows AdAway to edit the hosts file stored in <code>/data</code> while allowing the OS to use the file as if it were stored in <code>/system</code>.)</li>
<li>Reboot your device and set <cite>Target hosts file</cite> to <cite>/data/hosts</cite> in AdAway's preferences.</li>
<li>AdAway should work now.</li>
</ol>
