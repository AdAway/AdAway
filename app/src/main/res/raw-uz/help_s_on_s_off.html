<h2>HTC Devices</h2>
<p>AdAway does not work when you are using a device with so called S-ON. This 'feature' exists on many HTC devices and prevents AdAway from writing the hosts file.</p>

<h2>S-ON/S-OFF?</h2>
<p>S-OFF means that the NAND portion of the device is unlocked and can be written to. The default setting for HTC devices is S-ON, which means that neither can you access certain areas of the system nor can you guarantee a permanent root. Furthermore, signature check for firmware images is also ensured by the S-ON flag.</p>

<h2>Do I have S-ON or S-OFF?</h2>
<p>Boot into the Boot Menu on your device by holding down <i>volume down</i> button while pressing power and the text on top will show the flag status as either S-OFF or S-ON. A full root generally means S-OFF.

Additional S-OFF methods since Unrevokable (in link) might interest you, namely: Revolutionary, Revone, Firewater, RumRunner, Moonshine, SunShine...</p>

<h2>Workaround</h2>
<p>Prerequisite: You have to install a working Android SDK with ADB shell on your PC.

<ol>
<li>Boot into the Boot Menu on your device by holding down <i>volume down</i> button while pressing power.</li>
<li>Use <i>volume down</i> to select recovery.</li>
<li>In clockwork recovery volume down to "partitions menu" and hit the track pad to select</li>
<li>Select <i>mount /system</i>, <i>mount /sdcard</i> and <i>mount /data</i>.</li>
<li>Plug in your usb cord and open a command line on your pc.</li>
<li>Enter adb shell and type <tt>ln -s /data/hosts /system/etc/hosts</tt> (This creates a symbolic link, which allows AdAway to edit the hosts file stored in <tt>/data</tt> while allowing the OS to use the file as if it were stored in <tt>/system</tt>.)</li>
<li>Reboot your device and set <i>Target hosts file</i> to <i>/data/hosts</i> in AdAway's preferences.</li>
<li>AdAway should work now.</li>
