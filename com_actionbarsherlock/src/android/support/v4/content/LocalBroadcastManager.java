/**
 * Helper to register for and send broadcasts of Intents to local objects
 * within your process.  This is has a number of advantages over sending
 * global broadcasts with {@link android.content.Context#sendBroadcast}:
 * <ul>
 * <li> You know that the data you are broadcasting won't leave your app, so
 * don't need to worry about leaking private data.
 * <li> It is not possible for other applications to send these broadcasts to
 * your app, so you don't need to worry about having security holes they can
 * exploit.
 * <li> It is more efficient than sending a global broadcast through the
 * system.
