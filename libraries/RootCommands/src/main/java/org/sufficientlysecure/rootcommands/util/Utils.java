     * The problem is that Android doesn't allow us to modify the map returned by
     * ProcessBuilder.environment(), even though the docstring indicates that it should. This is
     * because it simply returns the SystemEnvironment object that System.getenv() gives us. The
     * relevant portion in the source code is marked as "// android changed", so presumably it's not
     * the case in the original version of the Apache Harmony project.
     * <p>
     * Note that simply passing the environment variables we want to Process.exec won't be good
     * enough, since that would override the environment we inherited completely.
     * <p>
     * We needed to be able to set a CLASSPATH environment variable for our new process in order to
     * use the "app_process" command directly. Note: "app_process" takes arguments passed on to the
     * Dalvik VM as well; this might be an alternative way to set the class path.
