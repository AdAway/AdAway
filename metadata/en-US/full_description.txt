An ad blocker that uses the hosts file. The hosts file contains a list
of mappings between hostnames and IP addresses. When an app requests
an ad, that request is directed to 127.0.0.1 which does nothing. There
are options to run a web server to respond to blocked hostnames and to
direct requests to the IP address of your choosing. You can download
hosts files from the app but it is possible to use your own and to add
certain sites to the white- and black-lists.
