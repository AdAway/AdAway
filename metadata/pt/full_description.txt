The application is available for rooted and non-rooted devices.
Using rooted device, the application update your system hosts file that contains a list of mappings between host names and IP addresses.
Using non-rooted device, the application use the VPN feature to block outgoing connections to ads and trackers.

You can download predefined ads and blocker lists as hosts files from within the app to incorporate. It is also possible to use your own files and to add certain hosts to allowed and blocked lists.
Existem opções para executar um servidor da Web local que responda aos nomes de hospedeiro bloqueados e que direcione os pedidos para os endereços de IP que escolher.
