Mongoose is a networking library for C/C++. It implements event-driven
non-blocking APIs for TCP, UDP, HTTP, WebSocket, MQTT.  It is designed for
connecting devices and bringing them online. On the market since 2004, used by
vast number of open source and commercial products - it even runs on the
International Space Station!  Mongoose makes embedded network programming fast,
robust, and easy. Features include:

- Cross-platform: works on Linux/UNIX, MacOS, Windows, Android, FreeRTOS, etc.
- Supported embedded architectures: ESP32, NRF52, STM32, NXP, and more
- Built-in protocols: plain TCP/UDP, HTTP, MQTT, Websocket
- SSL/TLS support: mbedTLS, OpenSSL or custom (via API)
- Asynchronous DNS resolver
- Tiny static and run-time footprint
- Source code is both ISO C and ISO C++ compliant
- Works with any network stack with socket API, like LwIP or FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP
- Very easy to integrate: just copy `mongoose.c` and `mongoose.h` files to your build tree
- Detailed [documentation](https://mongoose.ws/documentation/) and
  [tutorials](https://mongoose.ws/tutorials/)


# Commercial use
- Mongoose is used by hundreds of businesses, from Fortune500 giants like
  Siemens, Schneider Electric, Broadcom, Bosch, Google, Samsung, Qualcomm, Caterpillar to the small businesses
- Used to solve a wide range of business needs, like implementing Web UI
  interface on devices, RESTful API services, telemetry data exchange, remote
  control for a product, remote software updates, remote monitoring, and others
- Deployed to hundreds of millions devices in production environment worldwide
- See [Case Studies](https://mongoose.ws/case-studies/) from our respected
  customers like [Schneider Electric](https://mongoose.ws/case-studies/schneider-electric/) (industrial automation), [Broadcom](https://mongoose.ws/case-studies/broadcom/) (semiconductors), [Pilz](https://mongoose.ws/case-studies/pilz/) (industrial automation), and others
- See [Testimonials](https://mongoose.ws/testimonials/) from engineers that integrated Mongoose in their commercial products
- We provide [commercial licensing](https://mongoose.ws/licensing/), [support](https://mongoose.ws/support/), consultancy and integration
  assistance - don't hesitate to [contact us](https://mongoose.ws/contact/)


# Security

We take security seriously:
1. Mongoose repository runs a
  [continuous integration test powered by GitHub](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose/actions),
  which runs through hundreds of unit tests on every commit to the repository.
  Our [unit tests](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose/tree/master/test)
  are built with modern address sanitizer technologies, which help to find
  security vulnerabilities early
2. Mongoose repository is integrated into Google's
  [oss-fuzz continuous fuzzer](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?sort=-opened&can=1&q=proj:mongoose)
  which scans for potential vulnerabilities continuously
3.  We receive periodic vulnerability reports from the independent security
  groups like
  [Cisco Talos](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/talos.html),
  [Microsoft Security Response Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc),
  [MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org/),
  [Compass Security](https://www.compass-security.com/en/) and others.
  In case of the vulnerability found, we act according to the industry best
  practice: hold on to the publication, fix the software and notify all our
  customers that have an appropriate subscription
4. Some of our customers (for example NASA)
  have specific security requirements and run independent security audits,
  of which we get notified and in case of any issue, act similar to (3).

# Supplement software

This software is often used together with Mongoose:
- [mjson](https://github.com/cesanta/mjson) - a JSON parser, emitter and
  JSON-RPC engine. Used to implement
  RESTful APIs that use JSON, or implement data exchange (e.g. over MQTT
  or Websocket) that use JSON for data encapsulation
- [elk](https://github.com/cesanta/elk) - a tiny JavaScript engine.
  Used to implement scripting support
